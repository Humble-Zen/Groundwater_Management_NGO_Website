ðŸŽ® My First Web Development Project
While I'm not primarily into web development, I decided to give it a try and built this simple website to learn the basics. It's nothing special, but it was a great experience to dive into the world of web development, understand how to make and deploy a website, and get hands-on with the core functionalities.

ðŸ’» Key Features:

A basic website built with the fundamentals of web development
An embedded game that I created when I was just starting with game development ðŸŽ®
Itâ€™s a great way to reflect on my learning journey, and I look forward to building more projects and try new features.
